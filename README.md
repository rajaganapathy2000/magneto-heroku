# Using service accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
For Service Account to work, you must set USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS="True" in config file or environment variables
Many thanks to [AutoRClone](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) for the scripts
## Generating service accounts
Step 1. Generate service accounts [What is service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
---------------------------------
Let us create only the service accounts that we need. 
**Warning:** abuse of this feature is not the aim of autorclone and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 sa allow you plenty of use, its also possible that overabuse might get your projects banned by google. 

```
Note: 1 service account can copy around 750gb a day, 1 project makes 100 service accounts so thats 75tb a day, for most users this should easily suffice. 
```

`python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only`

A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the service accounts created

NOTE: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```

### Add all the service accounts to the Team Drive or folder
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```

# Youtube-dl authentication using .netrc file
For using your premium accounts in youtube-dl, edit the netrc file (in the root directory of this repository) according to following format:
```
machine host login username password my_youtube_password
```
where host is the name of extractor (eg. youtube, twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line
